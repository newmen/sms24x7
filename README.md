## Installation

    gem 'sms24x7'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sms24x7

## Usage

In the begining, you need to [register](http://outbox.sms24x7.ru/registration.php?pattern_id=2) for sending SMS through sms24x7 gateway.

Before sending SMS, you need to configure SmsApi with login credentials:

```
SmsApi.setup do |config|
  config.email = 'your@email.com'
  config.password = 'your_password'
end
```

There are two ways for sending your SMS.

The first - it's sending a SMS to one recipient. To do this, use:

```
SmsApi.push_msg_nologin('recipient_phone', 'sms_text', params)
```

here `recipient_phone` - is a phone number in format '7xxxyyyzzzz' and `params` - additional params that you can see in [documentation](http://sms24x7.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/api_manual.pdf).

The second way - it's sending multiple SMS to multiple recipients.

```
SmsApi.login do
  recipient_phones_str_arr.each do |recipient_phone|
    SmsApi.push_msg(recipient_phone, 'sms_text', params)
  end
end
```

here `recipient_phones_str_arr` - it's array that consist phone numbers as strings in format that represented above.
